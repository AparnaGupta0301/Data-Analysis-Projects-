This project, titled "Climate vs Cars," focuses on analyzing the factors that contribute to CO2 emissions from passenger cars and identifying ways to minimize these emissions. The study uses a dataset from the Canadian Government's Traffic Department, which includes data on various car attributes and their fuel efficiency over seven years (2010-2017). The dataset comprises 12 factors observed from 7,305 different vehicles, including make, model, vehicle class, engine size, transmission type, fuel type, fuel consumption, and CO2 emissions.

The analysis investigates the relationship between engine size, fuel type, and CO2 emissions, revealing that larger engines and premium gasoline are associated with higher emissions. Multiple regression models were used to predict CO2 emissions, with the most effective model incorporating fuel consumption, CO2 rating, vehicle class, and fuel type as predictors. Hypothesis tests confirmed that these variables significantly impact CO2 emissions, and a reduced model provided better predictive ability.

Advanced analysis highlighted the importance of considering fuel type and vehicle class as random effects in the models. The study concludes that controlling factors such as fuel consumption, CO2 rating, vehicle class, and fuel type can help reduce CO2 emissions from cars, contributing to efforts in mitigating climate change.
